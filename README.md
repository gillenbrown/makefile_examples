Some examples of how to use makefiles to automate data analysis

See the `single` directory for an example of a simple makefile pipeline with one data file. Just run `make` inside that directory.

The `multiple` directory shows how to automate a pipeline over many data files. First run `python make_data.py` to create the data, then `make` to run the pipeline.
